#Homepage

A simple page with links to my frequently visited sites that displays when I open Chrome.

You will need an API Key from [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) if you wish to use this. 

Once you have the API Key, create a file called `apiKey.txt` in the homepage folder with the contents being your API Key.
